# DatasetHub: A Unified API for Exploring Any ML Task

```python
import dataset_hub

housing = dataset_hub.regression.get_housing() # pd.DataFrame
```

## Installation
```bash
# Python 3.9+
pip install dataset-hub
```
If you run into installation issues, please write [here](https://github.com/GetDataset/dataset-hub/discussions/64)  

## Key Features

- **Unified one-line API** — load any dataset with `get_<dataset>()`.
- **Wide task coverage** — classification, regression, time series, and potentially more.
- **Rich documentation** — metadata, columns, examples, and source links.
- **Starter baselines** — quick starter models for every dataset.
- **Curated, not crowded** — a focused hub of easy-to-use, well-documented datasets.

## Supported Datasets

Every dataset in DatasetHub comes with a **ready-to-run baseline**, so you can start experimenting immediately.

## Why this library exists

Every time I wanted to try a new ML task from scratch, I faced a chain of steps:  
search for a suitable dataset → download it → load it into Python → write a baseline.  

Some of these steps were surprisingly complex, and sometimes I just gave up.  
The challenge grew even bigger when exploring new ML domains — take graph ML, for example — and honestly, I had no idea where to begin.

I created DatasetHub to solve this problem: it gives a **unified, easy-to-use interface** to access datasets, each with a ready-to-run baseline so you can start experimenting immediately.

## API Disclaimer

DatasetHub downloads datasets from external public sources. Because of this:

1. **Sources may become unavailable**  
If a dataset's original source (and mirrors) goes offline or changes, the corresponding `get_<dataset>()` function may stop working.
If this happens, please write [here](https://github.com/GetDataset/dataset-hub/discussions/64) 

2. **API may change**  
If a dataset is no longer publicly accessible, it may be removed from the library.

3. **Copyright**  
If a copyright holder requests removal of their dataset, we will comply and update the API accordingly.

## For copyright holders

If you believe your dataset should not be included, please contact us.
We will review the request and remove or restrict access promptly.
